# SINDy: Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems

This repository contains Python code for training a SINDy model for different dynamical systems, along with a set of example models that can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the code.

# Overview
SINDy is a data-driven approach for discovering the governing equations of dynamical systems. It can be used for model reduction, control, and prediction. The code in this repository uses PySINDy to predict the behavior of various dynamical systems, including linear and nonlinear systems.

# Models
The dynamical system model is defined in the Model section of the script. The current version includes four example models: cubic_2D, lorenz, quadratic, and linear_2D.

# Examples
This repository contains code for predicting the behavior of various dynamical systems. The cubic_2D, lorenz, quadratic, and linear_2D functions represent different dynamical systems. You can change the dynModel variable to switch between different systems.

To run the code, run the main.py file. This will generate plots showing the true behavior of the system as well as the behavior predicted by SINDy.
